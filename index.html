                                            British Raj, into a Parsi Zoroastrian family, on 28 December 1937.
                                             He is the son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the 
                                             Tata family, 
                                             and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological
                                            grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, 
                                            when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted
                                             by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata.He has a younger
                                              brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second
                                               marriage with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised.<br><br>
                                               He studied at the Campion School,
                                                Mumbai till the 8th class. After which, he studied 
                                                   at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai,
                                                    the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla,
                                           and the Riverdale Country School in New York City, which he graduated from in 1955. 
                                            After graduating from high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated 
                                            with a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1959. In 2008, Tata gifted Cornell $50 Million,
                                             becoming the largest international donor in the university's history.</p>

                                        <p class="description">In the 1970s Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata 
                                            group.
                                             He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio 
                                            and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an ecocnomi
                                             slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming 
                                             his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various
                                              subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior
                                               Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed 
                                               to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having
                                                subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries 
                                                to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised 
                                                innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent. Under his
                                                leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into 
                                                company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to 
                                                take on globalisation.<br> <br>  
                                            During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit
                                            over 50 times.When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised
                                            commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from
                                            brands. He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar 
                                            Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. 
                                            These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a largely India-centric group into 
                                            a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales 
                                            internationally.</p>
